The CControllerBase API. All controllers must subclass it.

1. data_structs : The generic data structures for the CControllerBase API.

2. gc           : A generic generalized coordinate (or joint space, for robotics) 
                controller. This should work with every model in scl.
                
3. task         : A generic multi-task controller + A set of generic tasks. These
                should work with every model in scl.
                
4. trajectory   : An online trajectory generation library. Use this in control
                implementations.
                
5. mtrack       : A subclass of the generic task controller, specifically for marker 
                tracking
