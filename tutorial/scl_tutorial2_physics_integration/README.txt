This is an example app. You need to compile (make) it and then run it.

1. Compile with the Makefile
#Debug mode (adds lots of debugging symbols to the application)
$ make
#Release (fast; no debugging information)
$ make release

2. Run
$ ./scl_tutorial2_physics_integration

(or run with output saved to a log file)
$ ./scl_tutorial2_physics_integration > log.txt
